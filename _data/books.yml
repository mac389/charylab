  notes: I very much liked the portrayal of Klara, as intellectualy simplistic yet trenchant and authentic. Mr. Ishiguro nicely dissociates emotional intelligence from declarative knowledge while showing that a machine could be more human in either than a human.

  notes: The narrative was uneven and Mr. Egan's use of jargon obscures his point. He explores the important idea of what it means to be human if you become a disembodied mind, and then even move to another dimension, but the exposition was much poorer than, say, Klara and the Sun.

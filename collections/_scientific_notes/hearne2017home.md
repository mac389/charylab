1. {% cite hearne2017home --file not-my-works -s apa %}:
   - **Summary:** The authors attempted to identify misinformation about home preparation of illicit substances by conducting a qualitative analysis of themes from 614 post across 5 web sites (This _n_ is comparable to the amount I used in my qualitative analysis of the doses and effects of DNP (manuscript under review).)
   - **Useful phrases**
     - > Communal folk pharmacology
   - **Methodological Issues**: I don't know how to apply the authors' metholodology to other data sets becasue the authors do not provide sufficient detail as to how they derived these topics.

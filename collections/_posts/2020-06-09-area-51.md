[Area 51](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_51) is a United States Air Force facility that may test experimental aircraft. It, in popular culture, also symbolizes a place the government keeps secrets from the public, e.g. the series [Roswell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roswell_(TV_series)) and the movie [Indpendence Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(1996_film)). Borrowing from that pop culture metaphor, most of my repositories have at least one `Area 51` where I put code that is obsolete for the current purpose or things that don't fit into any other category. 

 Voila.

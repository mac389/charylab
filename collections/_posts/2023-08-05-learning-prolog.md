I first encountered Prolog while reading [Seven Programming Languages in Seven Weeks](https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Languages-Weeks-Programming-Programmers/dp/193435659X). Prolog is a declarative language, rather than a procedural language, like Python or C++. I've continued to learn it in the hopes that it will improve my programming, similar to why I fitfully learn LiSP[^1].

### The Basics

### One Desired Use Case

There are many opportunities for improvement in scheduling ER shifts. As an attending I find the schedule reliably suboptimal. Most schedulers use a program to help them make the schedule. These programs are proprietary, but almost certainly use simplistic procedural programming under the hood[^2].

Footnotes:

[^1]: Those who view my repository will quikly note I use bash and python for my research. I'd like to use Prolog, but I have to choose a language that those I work with are facile in. Nor am I a Prolog guru.
[^2]: In my experience programs marketed to non-technical end-users with perpetual needs emphasize UI/UX over flexibility of functionality.

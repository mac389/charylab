the production of lactate does not increase hydrogen ions unless there is a compensatory impairment in oxidative phosphorylation

metformin hinhibits mitochondrial complex I -> activates AMPK -> increase glucose uptake

also inhibits mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase -> impairs gluconeogenesis, increases GLP-1 release from intestines, so stimulates GLP-1 receptos on pancreatic beta islet cells
Gliptins potentiate by inhibiting its inactivation by dpp-4.

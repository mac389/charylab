Andy Stapleton posted a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2936_Y80nUk&ab_channel=AndyStapleton) about how ChatGPT can be a research assistant and [another one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6c-8LGX8k&ab_channel=AndyStapleton) on AI tolls to boost research productivity.

### Writefull

[Writefull](https://writefull.com/) is a tool that uses AI to help you write better. It has a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/writefull/oknhllbdbololgmmmmkompgnbgbnhfjb?hl=en) and a [desktop app](https://writefull.com/download/). It can check grammar, spelling, and style. It can also check how often a phrase is used and how often a word is used in a particular context.

I found the free version somewhat useful for catching spelling and grammar endings in a documents I'd been working on for so long that I lose the ability to see those errors. It would rarely suggest useful alternatives. Writefull flagging the sentence would prompt me to reread it out of context.

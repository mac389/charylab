Learning languages is a hobby of mine. It's enjoyable to discover a new mode of expression. You need a lot of thoughtfully created material to learn a language. Learning material can be of varying quality even for widely spoken languages. It is sparser for rarer languages. 

##### Dictionaries
To create a dicitonary one needs a widely agreed upon way of writing and protocol for ordering words in that writing.

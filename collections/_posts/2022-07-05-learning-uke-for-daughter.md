### When I Bought a Ukelele

**2018**, I bought a ukelele at <a href="https://ukulelepuapua.com/">Ukelele Puapua</a> when my soon-to-be wife and I visited Oahu to research wedding venues. I bought a Kala ukelele to try out a new string instrument. I passably play the guitar and bass. When our first daughter came, I thought it wiser to play the ukelele for her than the guitar. She was curious and I thought she might hurt herself exploring the guitar. An acoustic guitar weighs about 5 pounds. A ukelele weighs about one pound.

**2024**. I bought a guitarlele and baritone ukelele.

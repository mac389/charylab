I switched from [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) to [NVIM](https://neovim.io/), inspired by Matt Might's [suggestion](https://matt.might.net/articles/programmers-resolutions/) to learn something new in Computer Science each year.

Lua plugins for NVIM are written in Lua, so I'm learning Lua.

[Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) mentioned [hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/), which uses Lua to automate MacOS processes.

### Overall Goal
1. Understand the sublethal toxicity of 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) using social media.
2. Develop tools to automatically update this knowledge. 

#### Scientific Output
1. Sublethal Patterns of 2,4-Dinitrophenol Use as Discussed on Social Media _(manuscript in preparation)_

#### Background 
Previous research focused on _lethal_ toxicity. This reflects the selection bias of case reports and calls to Poison Control Centers (PCC). There is, thus, a gap in our understanding of sublethal toxicity. DNP use appears to have increased. Of calls to PCCs, X/Y of them occurred since 2000 __(citation needed)__.

#### Why Use Social Media for DNP
The FDA has prohibited DNP for human consumption since 1938{% cite yen2012toxicity --file not-my-works %}.  Even if the FDA approved DNP for human consumption, it would still be unethical to conduct human trials We know that some doses of DNP are lethal and are not certain there is any safe dose. We can, ethically, use information that people who consumed DNP of their own accord freely provide. Social media provide just such a data stream. 

#### Methods
From social media we aggregate reports of DNP usage

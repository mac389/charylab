#### Overall Goal
The current standard of care in toxicology is to assess for abnormalities in myocardial conduction by using the same threshold in all patients, young and old, with and without heart disease. <b><u>Our goal</u></b> is to determine whether adjusting the threshold for age improves the diagnostic performance of the EKG in poisoned patients.

#### Scientific Output
- NYACEP and NAACT [posters](../pdfs/borst.poster.v2.branded.pdf){:target="\_blank"}
- White paper (in submission)

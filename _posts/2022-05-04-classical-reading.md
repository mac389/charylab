While Listening to the LRB Podcast I heard a promotion for a <a href="https://londonreviewbookbox.co.uk/products/close-readings-plus-among-the-ancients">guided tour through some Greek and Latin</a>. The offer cost too much. You pay for access to the podcasts and a new version of Emily Wilson's chosen editions. The idea, however, was attractive. This page chronicles my discovering the classics. Prior to this, I knew little about their content, less about their context, and even less about their influence.

#### Epic of Gilgamesh
*May 2022* I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6lsgPE90E&ab_channel=EricLuttrell">Eric Lutrell's lecture</a>.  The YouTube lecture was interesting when he discussed the evolution of our conception of an epic, but his description of the story didn't grab me. It was too allusive. I started to read Sophus Helle's [new translation](https://www.amazon.com/Gilgamesh-New-Translation-Ancient-Epic/dp/0300251181/ref=asc_df_0300251181/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=544446015557&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=7168345392889284666&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9067609&hvtargid=pla-1392800553339&psc=1). That book's introduction is very interesting, but the story didn't grab me as much. 

**Next Stpes**
1. ~~Lutrell's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_zwXOmC34">Lecture</a> on Books 6-12~~.  Listen to [John Harris' podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/epic-of-gilgamesh/id452027202?i=1000095847043). The first episode-- again background-- was interesting and engaging.

### Epic Cycle

#### Cypria

#### Iliad
*Feb 2022:* I began with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Iliad-New-Translation-Caroline-Alexander/dp/0062046284">Caroline Alexander's</a> translation of the Iliad and the <a href="https://trojanwarpodcast.com/">Trojan War Podcast</a>. This podcast covers the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Cycle">Epic Cycle</a> up to the Odyssey. At the same time I read <a href="http://madelinemiller.com/the-song-of-achilles/">Song of Achilles</a> by Madeline Miller. (I read <a href="http://madelinemiller.com/circe/">Circe</a> about 5 years ago when I had no deep understanding of the Epic Cycle and my frame of reference was the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0957608/">Wishbone episode</a>.)

*May 2022* I read Colleen McCullough's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Song-Troy-Colleen-Mccullough/dp/140911855X/ref=sr_1_14?keywords=colleen+mccullough&qid=1652180014&sprefix=collen+mccullou%2Caps%2C240&sr=8-14">The Song of Troy</a>. It is a modern retelling in the sense that there is more realpolitik rather than humans following fate's path. Achilles for example, has visions of his mother while he has seizures. The rift between Agamemmnon and Achilles is described as a ploy to lure Hector out of Troy rather than an clash for honor. I then read Claire Haywood's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Daughters-Sparta-Novel-Claire-Heywood/dp/0593184378/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=">Daughters of Sparta</a>.

*Jun 2022* I read Simone Weil's monograph, Iliad or the Poem of Force (citation). I also started Richard Lattimore's [translation](https://www.amazon.com/Iliad-Homer-Richmond-Lattimore/dp/0226470490) and associated [commentary](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226898555/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) by Malcolm Wilcox.

**Next Steps**
1. Learn about <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troilus_and_Criseyde">Troilus and Criseyde</a>, one of Priam's sons whom Achilles killed. Chaucer wrote a play about him. An example of how the Middle Ages understood the myth of the Trojan war differently because they had additional primary sources. Like the Latin accounts of Dares and Dictys


#### Aethiopis

#### Odyssey
*Mar 2022:* I read <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiN-77W34b3AhXshIkEHYAiC04QFnoECAYQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emilyrcwilson.com%2Fthe-odyssey&usg=AOvVaw1JJFr4JwhPpIIEqFP5LqSE">Emily Wilson's translation</a>. I found the Odyssey much easier to read than the Iliad. Perhaps it's the subject material. Perhaps Emily Wilson's translation. 

#### Teleogony

#### Aeneid
*Mar-Apr 2022:* I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aeneid-Vergil/dp/1984854127/ref=sr_1_1?crid=312K4J9MWSLZ0&keywords=aeneid+bartsch&qid=1649498703&sprefix=aeneid+bartsch%2Caps%2C812&sr=8-1">Shadi Bartch's</a> translation and listening to Susanna Braund's <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/virgils-aeneid/id384233916">Podcast from Stanford</a>.I had read parts of Books I and II in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Roma-Aeterna-Hans-H-%C3%98rberg/dp/1585102334">Roma Aeterna</a> and discussed it in <a href="https://scholalatina.it/en/scholae-de-litteris-latinis-latin-literature-courses/">Schola Latina</a>. I didn't appreciate the link between Dante going to Hell and Virgil going to the Underworld until I read the translation and listen to the podcast. The excerpts I read before didn't cover the latter half of the Aeneid.

**Next Steps**
1. Read the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dolphin-Editions-Virgils-Paideia-Institute/dp/1483418863">Paideia update</a> to <a href="https://vivariumnovum.it/risorse-didattiche/propria-formazione/classici-latini-edizione-monolingue">_Ad usum Delpinum_</a>.
1. Read Dickinson College's <a href="https://dcc.dickinson.edu/vergil-aeneid/vergil-aeneid-i-1-11">online annotated Latin</a>.
1. Read Hans Orberg's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vergil-Aeneis-Libros-Lingua-Latina/dp/158510633X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3E10HZLIB3GMR&keywords=9781585106332&qid=1650143014&sprefix=9781585106332%2Caps%2C87&sr=8-1">annotated version of Books I and IV</a>.
1. Read this <a href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0RtBAAAAMAAJ&rdid=book-0RtBAAAAMAAJ&rdot=1">1819 commentary on Virgil's Aeneid</a>, written in Latin. (That lead me to a nice link on his <a href="https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=0RtBAAAAMAAJ&pg=GBS.PA79&hl=en">Bucolics</a>.)

#### Dante's Inferno
*Apr 2022:* After reading the Aeneid in English I decided to continue chronologically rather than spreading out geographically (*e.g.,* to Indian Classical Literature). I chose Dante's trilogy because (1) Dante invokes Virgil as his guide and (2) I understand the journey into the underworld and its context better after reading the Odyssey followed by the Aeneid. I began by reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Divine-Comedy-Inferno-Purgatorio-Paradiso/dp/3903352004/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=dantes+inferno+mandelbaum&qid=1650369878&sprefix=dantes+inferno+mand%2Caps%2C99&sr=8-8">Allen Mandelbaum's translation</a>. I stopped reading the book after a month. The writing didn't grab me, although it flowed nicely. And, I dislike writing that is so allusive and referential that it is hard to get through a sentence without a commentary. To me, works of that type come off as obfuscatory or just plain showing off.

An ontology, in computer science, is an explicit unambiguous naming of entitites and the relationship between those entities in a domain of interest. The domain of interest is sometimes also called a portion of reality. 

#### Ontologies and Artificial Intelligence


#### Ontologies and Machine Learning
The world of ontologies has remained distinct from machine learning in some significant ways. To be sure, there are many machine learning algorithms [citation] that induce an ontology from the statistical properties of a text. This is an impressive technical demonstration that misses the point. Those ontologies usually describe the syntax but miss the semantics. 

Ontology creation _de novo_ is very difficult and, in my experience, too brittle to be extended by anyone except the developing team. 

I think that there is an unexplained relationship between ontologies to contrain the logic formalism component of Markov Logic networks.

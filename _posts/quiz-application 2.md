## Quiz Application

 Medical toxicology is the branch of medicine that specalized in the treatment of the poisoned patient. The word _poisoned_ here is used as argot. It designates a reaction to any toxin, be that from a snake, volcanic ash, ibuprofen, or arsenic. 
 
 One pursues training in medical toxicology, in the United States, after residency training in some form of medicine (Internal Medicine, Emergency Medicine, Pediatrics, Occupational Medicine, ...). I came to train in medical toxicology after residency in Emergency Medicine. I was struck by the lack of digital resources available to the trainee in medical toxicology. Emergency Medicine, in contrast, has three online question banks, a podcast that creeates about 15 hours of review content every month and innumerable web sites that digest, or at least masticate on, the latest trends. 
 
 This quiz application is my attempt to bring some of that technology to medical toxicology. It also provides an opportunity for me to increase my web development skills and to think about an ontology of toxicological knowledge. The word _toxicologic_ is used as telegraphic argot. To the scientist that word denotes the study of how and at what dose a substance leads to injury or death in a system. To the clinician, that same word denotes recognition of the manifestations of and treatment for those injuries in humans, with occasional reference to the underlying biology and pharmacology.

The American Board of Emergency Medicine requires residents to complete a scholarly activity. Most Boards do. There is a conflict between this requirement and the desires, training, and time of a trainee in Emergency Medicine. What makes an activity scholarly is changing. This requirement risks damping productive research for a _pro forma_ exercise. 

In 1999 the Research Director's Interest Group of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine released a consensus statement that scholarly activity is a core component of residency training in Emergency Medicine. [^1] In 2017 the Research Director's Interest Group updated their consensus statement, removing four types of scholarly activity (teach problem-solving skills; learn the art of medical writing; expose the resident to research for consideration of an academic career; help focus the resident on an area of interest or expertise) and (nearly) added six others (writing a case report, developing a curriculum, being a listed member on a consensus policy statement, writing and presenting a lecture, publishing original research prior to residency, participating in or creating an online blog or podcast).[^2] 

The items dropped and items proposed are illuminating. The original impetus for the requirement for scholarly activity was to increase the amount of clinical research germane to Emergency Medicine. Since 1999 the number of research articles indexed in PubMed with MeSH headings related to Emergency medicine has **X**. 

Academic emergency physicians may find themselves with conflicting demands. (Seemss unrelated to encouraging residents to peform research, maybe put in another notebook).

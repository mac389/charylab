#### The Scene 

 Academics need funding to support their direct costs and indirect costs. Direct costs refer to costs the researcher accumulates in the course of doing research. Indirect costs refer to the costs the researcher's institution encurs in supporting the researcher to do that research. The deisgnationas _direct_ and _indirect_ are subjective. Indirect costs are, I imagine, very direct for the instiution. Institutions like federal grants because federal grants authorize payment for both direct and indirect costs. Academics like federal grants because their institutions like federal grants. All this means that academics usually need to get a grant to be considered for promotion to tenure track and to have a few grants at differeing maturities to advance along the tenure track. To get to assistant professor I need a grant. My target is the K99/R00.

A crticism of artificial intelligence is that it is a _black box_, meaning that the process by which it transforms inputs to outputs is opaque. This opacity is not acceptable in healthcare where accountability requires transparency and, sometimes, the process is as important as the output. 

Thiagarajan et al. (2020) [published a preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14480.pdf) where they provide greater insight into what features a neural network uses to classify dermatologic lesions. Their approach is to identify a latent space with statisticall independent dimensions.
